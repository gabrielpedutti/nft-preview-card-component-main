## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first project, where I took a template and tried to replicate it only with the images and fonts used available.
It was a big challenge, especially regarding the functionality when hovering over the image.
I did a lot of research to make it work and I believe that by keeping this focus I will learn more and more.
